Narrator: Welcome to SSPS; the most prestigious school in Czechia.
Narrator: You are a student, and your name is: MenuNav.PlayerName
Narrator: You’re in your sophomore year approaching summer break, and so far your life is eternal hell combined with a miniscule amount of anguish.
Narrator: However, that’s the norm, so don’t worry about it too much.
Narrator: It’s a Friday morning and you’re on your way to everlasting damnation.
Narrator: By that I mean school, of course.
Narrator: Anyway, let’s go in.
Narrator: You enter the building, and you are instantly greeted by the most compassionate soul on this planet.
Ruzicka: Good morning MenuNav.PlayerName!
Ruzicka: I hope you’re doing well, how was your internship?
MenuNav.PlayerName: I’m doing great, thank you!
Narrator: That was a blatant lie.
MenuNav.PlayerName: My internship was rather productive, I learned a bunch of new stuff, and I can’t wait to go there again next year!
Narrator: I’ll be honest, your proficiency at lying makes me a bit concerned.
Ruzicka: I’m happy to hear that, MenuNav.PlayerName!
Ruzicka: ~places a hand on your cheek~
Ruzicka: Have a fun day today, all right? ~winks~
Narrator: Flustered, you mutter: “Thank you!” and run away.
Narrator: You enter class just to see some Linux-loving nerd approach you.
Narrator: You quickly turn your head to avoid having your face covered in a bunch of saliva from their overly enthusiastic Linux TED talk.
Narrator: Surprisingly, it worked; however, the Linux-lover ran away in tears due to not receiving the attention they wanted.
Narrator: Maybe that’s a good thing though.
Narrator: You look around, the class is completely empty.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Is it really worth teaching if there’s so few people in class today?
Narrator: As you mutter those words to yourself, you hear a door open and the most menacing and handsome figure enters the classroom.
Lacina: Just you today? What happened to everyone?
MenuNav.PlayerName: I’ve no clue. The only other student ran away, and I really don’t know why!
Narrator: Yes you do, that nerd won’t be able to recover from what you did for the rest of their life.
Lacina: Whatever, I guess. We might as well go over what you studied on Monday.
Narrator: 40 minutes pass, class is almost over, but you notice Mr. Lacina looking at you in a passionate manner while biting his lip.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Um.. is something wrong?
Lacina: You know, you look stunning today, what did you do to look this good?
Narrator: With that unexpected compliment, you start to blush and slightly look away.
Student: U-uh… t-t-this is how I normally look, I didn’t do anything special!!
Narrator: Lacina slowly walks towards you and you get backed into a corner.
Lacina: Is that so? I guess I just never noticed how beautiful you looked until now.
Narrator: After those words, even beets can’t compare to the color of your rosy face.
Narrator: His face gets closer and closer to yours..
Narrator: Could this be? A nobody like you receiving his first kiss from such a handsome man? Right here? Right now?!
Narrator: Alas, the bell rings, and you run away hastily, and ultimately, nothing happens. You missed the chance of a lifetime.
Narrator: It’s impressive that you managed to pull yourself together after that fiasco. There’s no time for praise though, it’s time for class.
Narrator: Once again, you enter the empty classroom and wait at least 15 minutes for the teacher to arrive.
Adamkova: Are you really the only one here? Jeez, everyone’s decided to skip huh?
Narrator: You nod as you get ready to show off your presentation skills.
Adamkova: Well, just do whatever you want. There’s no point in teaching with just you here, I’ll be in the classroom next to this one doing my own thing.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Oh, okay.
Narrator: She leaves, and you’re left to be in solitude for the next hour and a half.
Narrator: An hour and a half passes, and you get ready for PE.
Narrator: …
Narrator: What? You expected something?
Narrator: You’re an IT student, you get no play with women. Move on.
Narrator: After getting into your gym clothes, you enter the classroom.
Gregor: Hey! Are you the only one here?
MenuNav.PlayerName: Yeah. Guess everyone decided to skip or something.
Gregor: Oh well. This works too!
Narrator: After an intense session of working out and talking about chakras and third eyes, your gym class ends. Nothing eventful happened otherwise, let’s move on.
Narrator: As you enter the classroom, you feel an ominous aura enveloping you.
Narrator: You sit down and get ready for your programming class, although you wish the lights were on.
Narrator: As soon as you have that thought, the lights turn on.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Uhhh.. what?
Maly: Welcome to class today. Let’s get into today’s material.
Narrator: Mr. Maly starts explaining programming concepts, and you start spacing out and you ponder to yourself.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Something’s off, this isn’t how he usually is. What’s with his usual relaxed attitude?
Maly: Hey! Are you even paying attention?
MenuNav.PlayerName: Sorry! I just spaced out. I’ll start focusing on the class.
Maly: Oh an apology isn’t enough, buddy.
Narrator: Mr. Maly kicks your chair into the wall, you get cornered, once again. Are you just weak or do you not want to resist? Well, we both know it’s the latter, sicko.
Maly: I think it’s time I taught you a different lesson, MenuNav.PlayerName.
Narrator: Mr. Maly gets rid of his suit jacket as he keeps eye contact and establishes dominance over you.
Narrator: You start trembling, being unsure of what’ll come next.
Maly: Now, let’s teach you how to behave~
Narrator: Your heart starts beating rapidly, so much that you might even pass out soon.
MenuNav.PlayerName: I- um- I-I-
Narrator: You’re not able to handle the heat, you muster up all of your strength and push him away and escape the classroom.
Narrator: As you dash through the halls, you hear a menacing voice calling out your name.
Radko Sablik: MenuNav.PlayerName.
Narrator: Uh oh.
MenuNav.PlayerName: Yes, Mr. Principal?
Radko Sablik: I won’t question why you’re running across the halls-
MenuNav.PlayerName: Oh, thank yo–
Radko Sablik: HOWEVER!
MenuNav.PlayerName: Huh?
Radko Sablik: Are you an active student yet?
Narrator: Your heart sinks. Your life is over. The reaper has come for you early.
MenuNav.PlayerName: I’m sorry, but I didn’t have the time to–
Narrator: Suddenly, your vision goes dark. You are unable to see due to the black bag thrown over your head. You can feel yourself being dragged somewhere, but where?
Narrator: You regain vision; however, you wish you hadn’t.
Narrator: ‘Tis your fate, the fate of every inactive SSPŠ student. You are now condemned to spend eternity in the basement of SSPŠ.
Narrator: No one will look for you, and even if they do, they’ll never find you.
Narrator: I wish you luck, for you will need it.
